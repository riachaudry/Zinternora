            You choose a field and a length, then work through a published roadmap of weekly tasks.
            Every task has a defined deliverable. Every submission is reviewed by an evaluator who
            approves it, scores it, or sends it back with written feedback. At the end you have a
            final project, a score, and a certificate that anyone can verify from a public link.

            The Internora is an independent private training program. It is not affiliated with any
            government body or university, it is not an accredited institution, and it does not
            place people into jobs. Completing a program gives you reviewed project work and a
            verifiable record of it — nothing more, and nothing less.
