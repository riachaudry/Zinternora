  ['Is this a paid internship?', `No. ${brand.name} is a paid-for training program: you pay a one-time fee (${formatPKR(PLANS[4].fee)}) for the 1-month program. ${brand.name} does not pay a stipend or salary.`],
  [`Is ${brand.name} affiliated with a university or the government?`, `No. ${brand.name} is an independent private program. It is not accredited, not government-affiliated, and not connected to any university. The certificate records what you completed here.`],
  ['Will this get me a job?', 'It cannot guarantee one. What it gives you is reviewed project work, a final project you can show, and a verifiable record. How far that takes you depends on you and the market.'],
  ['How do I pay?', `Send the exact fee by Bank Transfer to ${brand.accountName}, ${brand.bankName}, IBAN ${brand.iban}. Then upload the transaction ID, date, amount and screenshot in your dashboard.`],
  ['How long does verification take?', 'Payments are checked by hand, usually within 24 hours. You are notified in the dashboard and by email either way. Nothing is auto-verified.'],
  ['When does my internship start?', 'An admin sets the real start date (a Monday) after your payment is verified. Your end date, every week window and every task deadline are then calculated from that date. Until then, your offer letter and tasks stay locked.'],
  ['Can I skip ahead to a later week?', 'No. A week unlocks only after at least 70% of the previous week\u2019s required task points are approved. This is enforced on the server, so it cannot be bypassed in the browser.'],
  ['What happens if I miss a deadline?', 'The task is marked overdue. You can still submit it, but an evaluator may score it lower. If a whole week stalls, message support from your dashboard and explain the situation.'],
  ['What file types can I submit?', 'PDF, DOCX, JPG, PNG, ZIP and TXT files up to 25 MB, plus links and written responses. Each task lists what it accepts.'],
  ['How is my final score calculated?', 'Weekly work is 70% and the final project is 30%. Each task is scored out of 100 and weighted by its point value.'],
  ['When do I get my certificate?', 'After every week is marked complete, the final project is approved, and admin issues it. It carries an ID and a public verification page.'],
  ['Who gets a letter of recommendation?', 'The top three finishers in a duration group are eligible. Each LOR is drafted, reviewed and approved by admin before it is issued — they are not generated automatically.'],
  ['Can I change my field or duration after applying?', 'Before your payment is verified, yes — contact HR on WhatsApp. After activation, the roadmap and dates are already generated and a change means starting a new application.'],
  ['Is my data private?', 'Your profile, submissions, payment details and documents are visible only to you and the admin team. Your public profile is off by default; you choose whether to turn it on.'],
